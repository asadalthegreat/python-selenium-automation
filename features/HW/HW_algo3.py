# Below The Arithmetical Mean
# When given a list, the program should return a list of all the elements below
# the original listâ€™s arithmetical mean. The arithmetical mean is the sum of all elements
# divided by the number of elements.
# Example: [1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 10, 2, 3] (The arithmetical mean is 4.25),
# Return [1, 3, 4, 2, 3]
#
# def below_mean(list):
#     mean = sum(list) / len(list)
#     x = 0
#     output = []
#     for i in list:
#         if list[x] < mean:
#             output.append(list[x])
#         x = x + 1
#     return output
#
#
# test = [1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 10, 2, 3]
# output = below_mean(test)
# print(output)




# Two Lowest Elements
# When given a list of elements, find the two lowest elements.
# They can be equal to each other or different.
# Example: [198, 3, 4, 9, 10, 9, 2], Return: 2, 3
